    1: "Brazil Dry Process Pedra Branca Brazil Dry Process Pedra Branca Pedra Branca always tops our list of Brazilian coffees for dual use. Burnt sugars, robust bittersweetness, hints of cinnamon, cacao, and a subtle fruit note marks the aroma. City+ to Full City+. Good for espresso. Full Cupping Notes City+ and Full City roasts harness robust chocolate roast flavors that are matched by a sweetness that holds on in the aftertaste. The aroma offers hints of dried peach, roasted almond, and cocoa nibs. The brewed cup has bittersweetness you expect from Brazil, underlying chocolate accents that add a pungent 'toasty' note to the sweetness too, like burnt sugar with a dusting of cinnamon. Fruits are limited to aroma, rather than flavor, but offer some mild complexity to the bittersweet core. Deep, chocolatey bass notes keep the coffee profile grounded at a wide range of roast levels. Once again Pedra Branca is at the top of our list of Brazil SO espresso, and can also be used to as a body/bittersweet component for an espresso blend base.

    2: "Fruit flavors find substantial sweetness in the middle roasts, tangy pomello and tangerine, stone fruits, and aromatic cardamom and mace. Deeper roasts show grape, blackberry, and chocolatey low tones. City+ to Full City+. Full Cupping Notes Mahiga shows both tart and dark fruit undertones depending on roast development, and spiced sweetness fills in the cracks. City+ roasts have a potent smell of spiced orange in the dry grounds, with dark berries cooked with warming spices. The wet aroma has the warmth and sweetness of fruit reductions, especially strong at City+ roast level. Breaking through the crust puffed a clove spice note too in the steam, adding a retronasal effect to the olfactory experience. The fruited elements find a nice supporting sweetness at City+ roast level. A citrusy tang leads to flavors of pomello and tangerine, shifting to tart stone fruits as the coffee cools, with some peach pit bittering in the aftertaste. Spiced notes of cardamom and mace compliment the fruited cup flavors and add to a complex aroma. I don't often recommend Full City roasts for Kenya's, but found Full City roasts of Mahiga to be super delicious. Deeper roast development brings out fruit flavors like grape and blackberry, along with notable dark chocolate low tones, and substantially thick body.

    9: "Full Cupping Notes Namku brings dense, bittersweet flavors to the cup at Full City and Full City+, a marrying of cocoa and rustic sweetness that pairs well for a daily drinking dark roast, and will most certainly stand up to milk or cream. The smells in the ground coffee and wet aroma have elements of unsweetened chocolate, accented by hints of molasses and toasted grain. The sweet side of the 'bittersweetness' comes up some in the cup, baking cocoa juxtaposed by flavors of unrefined sweeteners, like sorghum syrup and dark agave. There's a tobacco accent note as the coffee cools off some, as well as fruited hints of raisin and date, though much less focused than the low tones. Espresso shots were predictably delicious. After 5 days rest, my ristretto pulls were gold-flecked and velvety, with a sharp core flavor of bittersweet cacao bar that was accented by chicory, orange rind, and coriander. We have offered Tanzania coffees from the northern and southern areas, depending on weather patterns in the year, the chronic water problems in Tanzania, and the transportation issues to get the coffee out of the country without damaging it! I feel that, as far as Tanzania goes, you have to remain open-minded and flexible as to where the best coffee lots can originate due to all these factors. Here we found a nice lot from the Mbamba Bay area in the south, on the shores of Lake Malawi in what is known as the Mbinga district. Coffees in the south have some advantages of better drying conditions and better access to transportation. Namku is a newer cooperative in this region (coops are called \"AMCOS\", or Agricultural Marketing Cooperative Society), and currently serves almost 350 small farmers in Mbamba highlands. Altitude at the processing site is 1650 meters above sea level, and coffee is grown upwards of 1800 meters.",
    8: "The dry fragrance shows a complex range of fruit and cocoa smells that are highly dependent on roast level. City roasts have a scent of fruit and sweet cream, like strawberry milkshake, with a background layer of cocoa. Full City roasts are a little less fruited, with focused cocoa bittersweetness. The wet aroma is teeming with fragrant browned sugars, dried fruits, and a creamy hazelnut accent. This is one of those naturals (\"dry process\") that's pretty difficult to mess up in the roaster. I made three passes, one City (14F development), City+ (23F Dev), and the darkest Full City (35F post 1st C). All three roasts were super sweet, complex, and big bodied. Compared to other Ethiopia's, this isn't a bright cup either, though the City roast has ample structure. Light roasts have a nice mixture of spice and fruit notes, strawberry fruit filling, cinnamon streusel topping, and hints of fruit jams. This, and the City+ roast, where the only two that provided some floral aromatics too, though lower intensity than the fruits. Full City roasts bring about intensely bittersweet chocolate flavors, like high % cacao bar, and some baking chocolate in the aftertaste. Within the cocoa flavor matrix is fruited sweetness too, and as the coffee cools, profiles of cooked fruits come into play as well. We don't give a whole lot of Ethiopia's the green light for espresso either, but Dehab's coffee works incredibly well at Full City roast level and beyond. The syrupy textured shot pulls out rich dark chocolates with a swirl of red berry. I don't think it's the ideal flavor profile for milk drinks, but deserves all the spotlight as a single origin offering.Dehab Mesfin's 330 hectare coffee farm is located in Southwestern Ethiopia, near the Bonga forest in Kafa. Her farm includes 60 hectares of natural forest reserve, with 200 hectares planted in coffee that are divided into 7 different plots. Dehab acquired her farm as part of a land grant by the government, where large areas of semi-forested area were given to farmers with the idea that planting coffee while preserving the natural forest canopy would be an improvement toward sustainability. The setting at the farm looks like natural forest coffee, though it's actually considered \"semi-forest\" coffee, since the coffee is not wild, but the primary forest canopy is kept intact. In addition to processing her own coffee, Dehab buys cherry from local farmers as well, but does not mix the two. This is a single farm lot from Dehab's own estate, a first for us this year. They are mostly producing full natural process coffee, with smaller amounts of anaerobic naturals (fermenting the whole cherry for 72 hours before drying), and honeys that are produced with a small hand depulper. This is a dry process coffee, meaning the whole coffee cherries are laid to dry without removing the seeds (beans). The drying period can take up to 3 weeks depending on weather, and often results in a much fruitier flavor profiles than the wet process method. In addition to coffee, Dehab has an organic honey operation as well! Check out our video portrait of the Dehab Mesfin farm and honey cultivation in Gimbo, Kafa.

    7: "The smells in the dry fragrance leave little to the imagination and have a delicate touch. Clean raw sugar sweetness is marked by citrus accent notes, and complex spice tones when kept to a City/City+ roast level. The wet aroma has builds on these descriptors, the intensity of sweetness is boosted and offering more complex sugar caramelization smells. Ichamama AA smells so sweet, and the complex citrus and spice notes are an accurate precursor to the coffee's flavor profile. The underlying sweetness has unrefined sugars at City roast level, like demerara and turbinado, and a bright lemon note that adds to intense acidic impressions. The cooling cup offers up some muted fruit notes like cranberry, raspberry, and orange. But it's really the sweet/citrus combo that rings out loud and clear in this AA Ichamama coffee. I picked up on an herbaceous accent note in the finish too that reminded me of chamomile and lemongrass teas. After several sips, the baking spice notes hit the nose, like ginger powder and a hint of pineapple sage. This makes an excellent pour over, and offers a brisk morning cup, or after dinner coffee that serves as dessert!This coffee is from the Ichamama Factory, a washing station near Karima Hill in Nyeri. The station was named after the Ichamama river which flows near enough to the station to be the source of water for processing coffee. Ichamama is one of 19 washing stations that make up the Othaya Farmer's Cooperative Society, a coop-run organization, one of the older ones I might add. Othaya started in the mid-1950s, ballooning from 250 original members to 15,000 strong today. Karima is one of the older of the group, erected in 1964, and currently with nearly 1,000 farmer members (and is one of the most productive of the 19). The station sits at about 1750 meters above sea level, and coffee is grown in the higher altitude areas surrounding it. This is an AA outturn, which ranging from 17 - 19 1/64ths of an inch, is the largest Kenya screen size separation. Size doesn't always correlate to cup quality, but it does command the highest price. We found this AA Ichamama lot to be elegant, and refined, with focused sweetness and acidity. This is certainly a \"light and bright\" selection, but we also found developed sweetness and delicious accent notes in our medium roasts too.Region Nyeri Processing Wet Process (Washed) Drying Method Raised Bed Sun-Dried Arrival date July 2022 Arrival Lot size 50 Bag size 60 KG Packaging GrainPro Liner Farm Gate Yes Cultivar Detail SL-28, SL-34, Ruiru 11 Grade AA Appearance .4 d/300gr, 17-19 Screen Roast Recommendations City to Full City Type Farm Gate",
    11: "Alejandro Huisa's coffee presents the markers of a crowd pleasing coffee from the outset. The dry grounds have a bittersweet cocoa smell that's accented by subtle notes of raw sugar, and toasted grain. Bittersweetness is pronounced in the wet aroma, with notes of bittering baking chocolate, and dark chocolate chips. Middle roasts offer a no-frills cup, with opaque bittersweetness that will hold up to creamer, if that's your preference. On its own, the cocoa-laden cup profile unfolds to flavors of Dutch cocoa, dark chocolate-covered almond, and the earthy sweetness of carob chips. A lot of folks will find the mild acidity to be a plus too, and bittering core coffee flavors keep the profile from feeling limp. Espresso shots are a home run too, a satiny mouthfeel lending to the syrupy dark chocolate flavors that follow, accented by notes of tangy candied orange peel, and roasted walnut.Alejandro's 5 hectare coffee farm is in the JunÃ\xadn Province region, in a small village called Alto Pitocuna. This is the high part of the village, and his coffee farm \"El Solitario\" sits at 1500 meters above sea level. Half of his 10 hectare property is not developed, and the portion devoted to coffee is planted in CatuaÃ\xad cultivar. He is processing his coffee at home, fermenting the depulped coffee for 20 hours, washing off the fruit mucilage, and then drying inside parabolic drying rooms for about 10 days. His coffee is one of several purchased from the Cooperativa Valle Uburiki, a coffee farmer's association that operates in Pichanaki and represents 550 small holder coffee farmers in the region. Alejandro is actually one of the founders of the coop, going back 20 years. They are buying directly from the producers and offer different services for the members like business loans, drying patios and other processing improvements, coffee storage bags, organic fertilizers, and so on. The small premium they receive for their Fair Trade certification helps to fund those endeavors. They also have a technical support staff who provide agronomical assistance, and in the past few years jump started an organic farming initiative that they are rolling out to their coop members.Region Alto Pitocuna, Junin Province Processing Wet Process (Washed) Drying Method Covered Sun-Dried Arrival date January 2023 arrival Lot size 20 Bag size 69 KG Packaging GrainPro Liner Farm Gate Yes Cultivar Detail CatuaÃ\xad Grade SHB Appearance .4 d/300gr, 15-18 Screen Roast Recommendations City+ to Full City+ Type Farm Gate Recommended for Espresso Yes",
    10: "The dry fragrance has a molasses bread sweetness with accents of berry jam, stone fruit, and cinnamon. The wet aroma brings out a really nice cooked sugar sweetness, and fruit smells gain momentum as well, with some ripe berry aspects in lighter roasts. At City+, the coffee offers up a very nice apricot flavor that runs the range of canned fruit, to the natural dried types with a slight rustic quality, to the bittering aspect of apricot skin. The fruits are a little mirky when the cup is piping hot, but open up to more discernible flavors as you sit with it. I tasted a berry note when brewing my lightest roast, and with a slight tart aspect, it comes off like slightly underripe strawberry. This aspect also gives the impression of acidity, a nice addition for a fruity dry process coffee IMO! Dark roasts produce sturdy chocolate flavors and inky body, and the fruits are still present, but toned down quite a bit. This is another dry process Ethiopia I am thoroughly enjoying as espresso. We usually relegate these coffees for espresso blends, as the fruit-forward shots can be a bit overwhelming. But that's not the case for Senna Katta Mountain farm. Full City/Full City+ roasts bring together bittersweet chocolate and berry for a flavor profile of raspberry dark chocolate truffles.Senna Katta Mountain farm is located in the Boter forest preserve, Limu Kossa, Jimma. It's actually the only coffee farm in this remote forest area, and the small clearing made for their processing site is pretty easy to spot on an areal map amidst the surrounding sea of green! This isn't a clear cut coffee farm, but rather, part of a government land grant where plots in agro forest areas were given away to farmers who could be good stewards to the land by maintaining the natural forest habitat. Senna Katta Mountain is owned by wife and husband Yodit, and Solomon. They are both pharmacists who met when opening a clinic in Limu Kossa sometime ago. Yodit's father was an agronomist in Jimma, working for the government, and it was their dream to build a farm in the area. With his help as their advisor, they did just that, stepping in as owners after the original owner was unable to keep up with the land improvements that were required. Senna Katta Mountain is 130 hectares in size, though only 110 hectares are under production. It's considered semi-forest coffee since it's not wild coffee, but still grows beneath the preserved forest canopy overhead. This is a very high elevation zone, the mill at 2300 meters with coffee growing even a little higher. Because of this, the coffee comes a bit later than most other areas we buy from. They still had a lot of cherry on the trees when we visited December 2022. They are also providing coffee plants to local small holder farmers and are hoping to start a farmer's association next harvest.Region Limmu Kossa, Jimma Processing Dry Process (Natural) Drying Method Raised Bed Sun Dried Arrival date August 2022 Arrival Lot size 181 Bag size 60 KG Packaging GrainPro Liner Farm Gate Yes Cultivar Detail Heirloom Cultivars Grade Grade 1 Appearance .9 d/300gr, 15-17 Screen Roast Recommendations City+ to Full City+ Type Farm Gate Recommended for Espresso Yes",
    12: "Gitwe shows fragrant baking spice notes in light roasts that add a delicate touch to a clean, refined cup profile. Honey and light brown sugar sweetness linger in the dry fragrance, and are accented by notes of whole cardamom, and malted grains. Adding hot water frames a saturated sweet aroma with notes of cinnamon and sugar, honey graham cracker, and black tea. Light roasts brew up clean transparent sweetness, accented by aromatic spices overhead like whole clove and cinnamon. A dried apple hint helps fill out this coffee's somewhat quiet fruited side, and lemony citrus is brought to light as the cup cools off some. The latter combines nicely with the black tea/tannic flavors, and lead up to a complex Assam tea note in the aftertaste. Full City roasts pull out a sweet chocolatey side, along with some darker fruit notes that come up as you move through the cup. Full City roasts also help temper the vivid brightness if you're looking for a rounder cup profile that's more about chocolate bittersweets.The Gitwe washing station is located in Rwanda's southern Nyamasheke District. We started buying this coffee back in 2018, and actually, after tasting a sample on an origin trip that year, rearranged our travel plans to make sure we saw the site! (It's actually very close to Gatare - another coffee we buy - so fitting it into the drive wasn't too difficult). They've made quite a few improvements to their washing station since that first visit, investing in a water filtration system, and storage system unlike any we've seen in Rwanda. Gitwe sits at roughly 1800 meters above sea level, and the farms of the 800 out growers who deliver their coffee to Gitwe are situated between 1800 and 2000 meters. Gitwe produces both wet and dry process coffees, and have ample fermentation tanks and patio space to handle incoming coffee during the harvest peak.

    4: "Glimpses of tea notes and sweet baking spices are sensed when grinding up light roasts of Kibingo, alluding to a complex cup early on. The wet aromatics smell delicious at both City and City+ roast levels and breaking through the crust, you're hit with a heady sweetness of maple with an array of warming spices behind it. Light roasts of Kibingo make great pour over brews, pulling out the bright cup characteristics, clean sweetness, and top notes. The flavor profiles include aromatic tea notes like orange spice and tart jamaica, giving way to raw sugar flavors, and a spiced mixture of clove and mace. I catch soft glimpses of fruit as the cup cools down a bit, and tart cranberry note leads to refreshing brilliance that livens up the cup. City+ roasts showed some bitter cocoa hints layered into the sweetness, as well as a red cherry note, and still with moderate acidic impression. My darkest roast was very close to reaching 2nd C (36F of development post 1st Crack), and I was taken aback by the cup sweetness intermixed with roast tones of smoked dark chocolate, and ginger hint.Kibingo Station is a coffee cherry collection site located in Kayanza, Burundi's northern province that borders neighboring Rwanda. The washing station acts as a central delivery site for a few thousand small holder famers who occupy the 18 hills that surround Kibingo. Farmers grow mostly older bourbon types, the original coffee cultivar introduced to the area in the 1930s by Catholic monks traveling from the island of Reunion. Kibingo sits at just under 1900 meters above sea level, and many of the farmers have coffee planted much higher than this. Kibingo is named after reeds that are growing in the river running alongside the station site, planted in order to help keep the soil at the banks from eroding. They've been around since the mid 1980s, and last year Kibingo took 1st place at the Burundi Cup of Excellence competition, no small task. Kibingo roasts easily, very little roast color variance as you move from yellowing, to browning, and onto first crack. It helps that the sort is so good, with little to no trace of underripe coffee in the few hundred grams of coffee that we roasted.Region Kayanza Province Processing Wet Process (Washed) Drying Method Raised Bed Sun-Dried Arrival date January 2023 Arrival Lot size 80 Bag size 60 KG Packaging GrainPro liner Farm Gate Yes Cultivar Detail Bourbon Grade A1 Appearance .2 d/300gr, 15+ screen Roast Recommendations City to Full City Type Farm Gate Recommended for Espresso Yes",
    13: "Once again, Macuba dry process proves to be a fruit-forward coffee no matter what roast you throw at it. The lighter roasts smell of berry and chocolate-cherry cordials, with fruit liqueurs and jam. The cup flavors have an aromatic quality to the berry fruit that is a bit floral, like a ripe blackberry. The fruit has a winey aspect behind it, but any edginess is cut through by a welcome berry-like vibrance that really props up the wilder fruit notes. My dark roast was almost to Full City+ (35F post 1st Crack), which mellowed out the fruit a bit, though it was far from buried. The roast bittering is the flavor you taste first - a smokey bittersweet note - but dark fruits are tucked behind that bittersweet layer, and begin to come into view as the coffee cools down. bubbling up from beneath a bit as the coffee cools. The coffee aroma is heady with juicy berry notes and bittersweet roast, a pairing that brought to mind strawberries dipped in dark chocolate.The Macuba station is located in Macuba town, within the Nyamasheke region of Rwanda's Western Province. The site produces both wet and dry process coffee, both of which we picked up this year (look for the washed coffee in July!). Macuba serves almost 500 farmers in the surrounding highlands, most with less than 1 hectare of coffee. At 1685 meters, the milling site is at a much lower altitude than most of the coffee that comes in, many of the farms reaching above the 2000 meter mark. The station employs many grading techniques to separate out the top quality coffee, starting with the whole coffee cherry being submerged in tanks of water, and removing the low density coffee that floats to the top. The dry process coffee is then moved to raised drying tables where it will dry over the course of a few weeks. During this time, the cherry is turned by hand, and the workers continue to remove any coffee with physical defects they find along the way. All this care and attention results in a very uniform coffee for dry process, making it much easier to roast, as well as a very consistent brew.Region Macuba, Nyamasheke, Western Province Processing Dry Process (Natural) Drying Method Raised Bed Sun-Dried Arrival date January 2023 Arrival Lot size 50 Bag size 60 KG Packaging GrainPro Liner Farm Gate Yes Cultivar Detail Bourbon Grade A1 Appearance .6 d/300gr, 15-17 Screen Roast Recommendations City to Full City+ Type Farm Gate",
    5: 'The dry fragrance has balanced sweetness and low tones all the way up to Full City (and probably beyond), with accents of light and dark brown sugars, and dark cocoa in the more developed roasts. The wet crust is all about clean sweetness for me, with more fragrant molasses hints, C&H type light brown sugars, and heavier roast bittering in the Full City/Full City+ range. Medium roasts show persistent sweetness in the brewed coffee that spells out to accents of honey and nougat-type candy center, and pistachio torrone. Light roasts have a nice, tannic acidic impression that\'s on the mild side, but adds a subtle black tea note to the flavor profile, accented by a hint of citrus peel. Full City roasts boost deep chocolate low tones, along with faint dark fruited background notes. This coffee is big-bodied no matter roast level, with pleasing, rounded mouthfeel. For those looking for a Colombian espresso option, expect syrupy chocolate and a surprising berry bright spot, along with viscous mouthfeel and lasting bittersweet finish. This "Veredas Vecinas" blend is made up of coffees from neighboring villages in InzÃ¡, Cauca. While the regions are hardly neighboring each other, the veredas ("villages") where they were pulled from are. The bulk of the coffee is from a buying operation in San Antonio, within the Southwestern Colombian region of InzÃ¡ de Cauca. As you make the drive from La Plata to InzÃ¡, you follow the Rio PÃ¡ez, and an eventual crossing over a suspension bridge lands you on the road to the villages where we buy coffee. Like much of Colombia, Cauca is home to very high altitude farms, many above the 2000 meter mark. The coffees that make up this lot were harvested from an altitude range of about 1500 to 2000 meters. We make up these regional blends by cupping several samples from the individual farms, separating out those that meet a certain cup criteria, and then blend them together. Having this level of quality control with our Colombian blends is a great benefit to us, and allows us to really mix and match coffees to come up with a flavor profile that no single coffee could achieve on its own. This is a wet-processed coffee, most farmers using old style depulpers that are powered by hand-crank or small motors, then fermenting and washing the coffee in the same tank, and finally drying the coffee in covered drying rooms called "parabolicos".

    3: "There's a nice and simple sweetness found in the dry fragrance, something like semi-refined sugars, with a note of chocolate bread, and malted milk powder. The wet aroma has a chocolate-nut smell to it, with a hint of rye grain. City+/Full City is where this coffee excels, offering chocolate flavors that carry mild sweetness behind them, like semi-sweet chocolate bar, Dutch cocoa powder, and chocolate malted grains. The flavor profile is one to enjoy brewed, not so much from cupping spoon, as it doesn't have showy acidity, or fruit. It's a daily drinking coffee through and through, and I found that as it cooled, cocoa and carob notes held up nicely, and opened up a little to include some flavor notes of cocoa puffed rice cereal, and raw pistachio.

    6: "The fragrance possessed a scent of cinnamon roll and chocolate malt. The sweetness is noteworthy, and really comes through when pouring hot water on the grounds. There's a very nice cooked brown sugar note that comes up from the grounds, with a dusting of baking spice, and a hint of roasted nut. Initially, the cup flavors at City roast level are sweet and with brisk acidity. A flavor of honey-sweetened black tea came to mind while drinking it, and feels well-structured by acidity. The coffee cools to a honey-glazed almond note, along with a citrus hint. Full City has quite a lot of bittering cocoa flavors, but the underlying sweetness remains resolute. Flavors noted were torched sugar, red raisin, and an abundance of bittersweetness ala Dutch drinking chocolate. An exceedingly sweet Costa Rican coffee that will serve you well as an everyday drinker. This microlot is a blend of coffees from the various plots managed by Cesar Esquivel at Cerro La Cruz, a relatively new micromill that he has built in Tarrazu. This particular lot is mechanically washed, which means that in stead of using fermentation to remove the sticky fruit after depulping, they strip both cherry and fruit away using a mechanical demucilager equipment. It's the same machinery used to produce honeys. A simple adjustment to the demucilager affects how much fruit is left intact after depulping. The more fruit, the wilder the cup flavors. This lot was processed as what's referred to as \"White Honey\" in Costa Rica, which just means they remove as much fruit as possible without scoring the seed. The resulting cup is a close approximation to \"fully washed\", fermented coffee, with clean cup flavors, and acidity that sparkles. There is a bit more chaff produced during roasting than a fully washed coffee, but nowhere near the amount of dry process or honey process coffees. The coffee also presents darker during the roasting process, which is something to pay attention to when judging roast level, as they are often slightly lighter than they appear. The city of San Marcos is in the Talamanca Sierra highlands, with peaks reaching as high as 3000 meters.

    16: "This lot from Gakenke has syrupy sweetness in the light and middle roasts, spiced accent notes, and vibrant, citric acidity. The dry fragrance lets off profuse sweetness from the ground coffee, like vanilla taffy and creamy caramels, with complex spice hints. The aroma has honey sweetness, and breaking through the crust peels back layers of raw sugars and clove spice that liven up the steam. Burundi's can be quite complex, and Gakenke definitely treads familiar territory from this incredible coffee origin. The cup flavors at City pull out a substantially sweet brew, accented by an array of sweet spice and black tea notes. Staying north of Full City leads to cup characteristics of fine black teas with lemon, and spiced hints bring up a profile of Darjeeling tea. The acidity level is pretty lively too, and threads together aromatic accent notes of clove and bergamot citrus in the aftertaste.

Gakenke sits at 1675 meters above sea level, and many of the farmers have coffee planted much higher than this. Gakenke is named after a plant that grows wild in the area with thin, hollow stems that are commonly used to drink the locally made banana beer. Gakenke pulls clean water from the Rivubo river that runs alongside the station site. During the harvest season 1,900 local coffee farmers from 22 neighboring villages sell their coffee to Gakenke, where it is processed as fully washed and naturally in whole cherry.Region        Kayanza Province Processing        Wet Process (Washed)Drying Method        Raised Bed Sun-DriedArrival date        January 2023 ArrivalLot size        40 Bag size        60 KGPackaging        GrainPro LinerCultivar Detail        BourbonGrade        A1Appearance        .2 d/300gr, 15-17 ScreenRoast Recommendations        City to Full CityType        Farm Gate",
    15: "This coffee from Masha has spiced sweetness in the dry fragrance, a mixture of baking spices and dark, raw sugars, along with dark caramel and hints of fruit. City and City+ roasts smell very clean, and the wet aroma takes on characteristics of dark honey, with a touch of dried apricot wafting in steam. Masha is a clean tasting coffee and an example of just how versatile Burundi coffees can be in the roaster. The cup is sweet across a wide range of roasts, base flavors coming across like honey, sugar in the raw, and a nice vibrant tea side too. City roasts have a distinct cinnamon caramel flavor, with layers of spice and fruit that accent the abundant sweetness underneath. Though cup sweetness is the focus at almost all roast levels, hints of dried currant, jamaica flower-like tartness, ginger powder, and candied lemon add a delicate aroma to the light roasts. Full City roasting brings about roast tones you'd expect, but also matched by intense burned sugar sweetness, and dark fruit accent note. Masha is well worth a run through your espresso machine if you're looking for a single origin espresso option that offers flavors of sweetened cocoa with fruited and spiced highlights.Masha Station is a coffee cherry collection site located in Gatara Commune, Kayanza, Burundi's northern province that borders neighboring Rwanda. The washing station acts as a central delivery site for a few thousand small holder famers who occupy the hills surrounding Masha. The name comes from the Kirundi word amasho that means herds of cattle. That makes sense seeing that cattle herding just might rival coffee farming in the Masha region! Farmers grow mostly older bourbon types, the original coffee cultivar introduced to the area in the 1930s by Catholic monks traveling from the island of Reunion. Masha coffee washing station (CWS) sits at just under 1700 meters above sea level, and many of the farmers have coffee planted much higher than this. They've been around since 1989, and in 2012 were top placement in Burundi Cup of Excellence competition, no small task. Masha roasts easily, very little roast color variance as you move from yellowing, to browning, and onto first crack. It helps that the sort is so good, with little to no trace of underripe coffee in the few hundred grams of coffee that we roasted.Region        Gatara Commune, Kayanza Province Processing        Wet Process (Washed) Drying Method        Raised Bed Sun-Dried Arrival date        January 2023 Arrival Lot size        80 Bag size        60 KG Packaging        GrainPro Liner Farm Gate        Yes Cultivar Detail        Bourbon Grade        A1 Appearance        .2 d/300gr, 15-17 Screen oast Recommendations        City to Full City+ Type        Farm Gate Recommended for Espresso        Yes",
    14: "Wow, this is an amazing dry process espresso! I actually finished this review a couple of days ago, but am hopping back in to make a quick edit having just tasted my Full City roast as an espresso shot with a few days rest. Roast flavors have a creamy bittersweetness, and the fruits are plump and berry-toned. There are notes of berry jam, and pomegranate juice (without the acidity), but the intense bittersweetness somehow overcomes all of that in the aftertaste. It makes an incredible solo shot, but perhaps a touch fruity for steamed milk (in my opinion). Superb! OK, back to the brew review.... At City+, I get smells of dried fruits and cocoa powder, and a cream/fruit smell like chocolate-banana milkshake. The level of sweetness is quite nice at this roast level and rustic elements are kept to a minimum. The wet aroma has more intense fruited sweetness, and even at Full City, I pick up on a really nice blueberry note wrapped in bittersweet chocolate. The fruits that come through in the coffee are a little hard to pinpoint at first, but berry was the first descriptor that came to mind in both my roasts. City+ roasts open up to flavors of dried natural apricot, tamarind, and a dusty hint of dehydrated strawberry. Notes of date sugar and cocoa powder help to buffer the fruit flavors, and tend to linger in the aftertaste. Boy did my darker Full City roast have nice body! Chocolate bittersweets are a constant at this roast level, but with flavorful accents of dried blueberry, date, and raisin.Dabessa coffee farm and wet mill is located near the village of  Wolensu, in Limu Kossa region. This 150 hectare farm and processing site is owned and operated by Mesfin Dabessa and his family. They are producing both dry process and fully washed coffees, having erected a washing station onsite back in 2015. This lot is a dry process coffee, where the whole cherry is laid to dry on raised beds and not removed until both fruit and seed (green bean) are down to 10-11% moisture. As you might expect, this takes a little longer than wet process coffees, and tends to result in fruitier cup flavors. While many coffee farms in Jimma are seeing a lower harvest this year, Mesfin's farm saw an increase in production. A big part of this is due to having so many younger trees on the farm. Mesfin told his the oldest trees are 11 years old. Wolenso Dabessa was acquired as part of a land grant by the government in 2008, where large areas of semi-forested area were given to farmers with the idea that planting coffee while preserving the natural forest canopy would be an improvement toward sustainability. While this is where Dabessa got his start, his father's history growing coffee in the region dates back to 1946. Dabessa's washing station happens to be on the site of his original farm. The farm and mill sit at around 1800 meters above sea level, and coffee is grown up to 2000. They are also buying cherry from local small holder farmers, who together account for another 100 hectares of coffee.Region        Wolenso, Limu Kossa  Processing        Dry Process (Natural) Drying Method        Raised Bed Sun-Dried Arrival date        January 2023 Arrival Lot size        160 Bag size        60 KG Packaging        GrainPro Liner Certifications        Certifications Farm Gate        Yes Cultivar Detail        Heirloom Cultivars Grade        Grade 1 Appearance        .8 d/300gr, 14+ Screen Roast Recommendations        City+ to Full City+ Type        Farm Gate, Organic/Fair Trade Cert.",
